# Stocktaking

this is a small beginner Project i made to automate a process in our Company

i don't know if anyone else does something like this, but i always have to check one by one if the SimCard is here.

now i made a script that automate this progress.
You just have to enter the Sim card that you should have on a textfile with the name soll_bestand
and the Sim Card you actually have in the scan_bestand

than just run it and you get the Sim cards which are missing
